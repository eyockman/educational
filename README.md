code to share with students and friends!

test.csv = made up data set showing some made up heights of 3 different species (clarkia, raphanus, trifolium) to use in test.R
test.R = beginner code to show how to make a boxplot and do a basic ANOVA

survcurv.R = some code walking through survival curves with Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox Proportional Hazard model examples. The descriptions and explanations aren't great on this one, I'm still working on it. Most of the code is sourced from statology (self note: find link and cite properly).

vision.R = initial exploration of the retinopathy dataset in the survival package. prep for a survival curve mini workshop I gave to ESNERR staff. Comments pretty in depth.
vision_model.R = follow up to vision.R, file used during workshop with ESNERR staff. Comments OK but leave a bit to be desired.
