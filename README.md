best one to start with is probably **test.R** or **randomdata.R**

## FOLDERS ‚ùÄ

- **lit review** = data downloaded from Web of Science search when I was looking for publications mentioning competition and facilitation in Ecology; makes a nice plot

- **NorrisCenter** = data from CCH2; planning to use for collection summary statistics 


## UNSORTED FILES ‚ùÄ

- **.gitignore** = don't worry about this
- **educational.Rproj** = this is just my workspace snapshot, don't worry about this either
- **hashmap.R** = Mick walking me through hashmaps and using the hashmap tutorial on the package page
    - Package used: [`r2r`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/r2r/index.html)
- **mid.R** = how to load in excel data, not csv!
    - Package used: [`readxl`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html)
- **mid.xlsx** = fake data made up to use in mid.R
- **randomdata.R** = randomly generated scatterplot; originally made to use as a visual aid but is quick reference for how to randomly generate some simple data
    - Package used: [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), 
- **survcurv.R** = some code walking through survival curves with Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox Proportional Hazard model examples. The descriptions and explanations aren't great on this one, I'm still working on it. following RStudio Blog tutorial by Joseph Rickert https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/09/25/survival-analysis-with-r/

    - Package used: [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
- **test.csv** = made up data set showing some made up heights of 3 different genera (*Clarkia*, *Raphanus*, *Trifolium*) to use in test.R
- **vision.R** = initial exploration of the retinopathy dataset in the survival package. prep for a survival curve mini workshop I gave to ESNERR staff. Comments pretty in depth.
