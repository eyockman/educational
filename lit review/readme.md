# lit review 

This is a cursory data visualization of publications that mention the topics competition and facilitation in Ecology related journals.
This is one way we can visualize how the field of ecology has paid attention to these topics!
This is not a super well designed search (-- couldn't submit this in a meta-analysis paper!), but it can help us see how much these two topics relatively get talked about!

Competition refers to a potential negative interaction between species, possibly *competing* for the same resource.

Facilitation refers to a potential positive interaction between species, possibly reducing stress through soil stabilization (like in dune plants), or protection from herbivores (unpalatable shrubs!).
